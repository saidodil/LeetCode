/*
DESCRIPTION

Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name that was previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique. Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.
